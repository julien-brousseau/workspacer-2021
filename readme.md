# Workspacer
This extension allows you to save groups of regularly used tabs and open them all at once in browser windows. 
Tabs can be renamed, pinned and reordered.

## Context and disclaimer
I built this extension as a personal project to get back into programming.
It is far from perfect, and despite my best efforts it may contain bugs. Use at your own risk.
